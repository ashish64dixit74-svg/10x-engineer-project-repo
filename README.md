# PromptLab

**PromptLab** is an internal tool designed for AI engineers to store, organize, and manage their prompts. Built on the FastAPI framework, PromptLab provides a streamlined interface to efficiently handle the complexities involved in prompt engineering.

## Project Overview

PromptLab serves as a platform to help AI engineers manage their creative workflows by organizing prompts into collections, allowing for searching, filtering, and version control. It aims to enhance productivity by simplifying prompt management and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Prompt Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve prompts.
- **Collection Management**: Create and manage collections of prompts.
- **Search and Filter**: Search prompts and filter them by collection.
- **Health Check**: API endpoint to check the health and version of the service.
- **CORS Support**: Enables cross-origin resource sharing for integration with other services.

## Prerequisites and Installation

- **Python 3.9+**: Ensure Python is installed in your environment.
- **FastAPI**: Install FastAPI as the web framework.
- **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server for serving FastAPI applications.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PromptLab
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start Guide

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

- The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI.

## API Endpoint Summary

### Health Check

- **GET** `/health`: Returns the current health status and version of the service.

### Prompts

- **GET** `/prompts`: Retrieve a list of prompts, optionally filtered by collection or search query.
- **GET** `/prompts/{prompt_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific prompt.
- **POST** `/prompts`: Create a new prompt.
- **PUT** `/prompts/{prompt_id}`: Update an existing prompt entirely.
- **PATCH** `/prompts/{prompt_id}`: Partially update fields of an existing prompt.
- **DELETE** `/prompts/{prompt_id}`: Delete a specified prompt.

### Collections

- **GET** `/collections`: List all collections.
- **GET** `/collections/{collection_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific collection.
- **POST** `/collections`: Create a new collection.
- **DELETE** `/collections/{collection_id}`: Delete a specified collection and all related prompts.

## Development Setup

1. Ensure `Python 3.9+` is installed.

2. Install dependencies in a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run tests to validate setup:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest tests
   ```
